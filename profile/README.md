## Overview

Dashxboard was created as an open-source project as part of a bounty from the SHx [Ecosystem Development Program (EDP)](https://docs.shx.stronghold.co/ecosystem/edp). Its goal is to promote transparency and community involvement by providing a space that support active participation and collective decision-making.

This repository hosts the code for the Discord bot, website, and database that together form the Dashxboard platform.

- **[@dashxboard/bot](https://github.com/dashxboard/dashxboard-bot)**: Discord bot for the Dashxboard platform.

- **[@dashxboard/web](https://github.com/dashxboard/dashxboard-web)**: web interface for the Dashxboard platform.
